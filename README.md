üöÄ 3D Print Order & M-Pesa Automation Service
This is a serverless application built with Node.js and Express that manages the entire lifecycle of a 3D printing order, from file upload and M-Pesa payment processing to final storage in Google Cloud Storage and administrative tracking.

It is designed to run efficiently on Google Cloud Run, taking advantage of its scale-to-zero capabilities for cost optimization.

‚ú® Features
Secure File Upload: Users can upload 3D model files (STL, OBJ, etc.).

M-Pesa STK Push Integration: Initiates Lipa na M-Pesa Online checkout request directly to the user's phone.

Real-time Callback Handling: Dedicated server endpoint handles the M-Pesa Confirmation callback (/api/mpesa/callback).

GCS Integration: Successful payments trigger the automatic upload of the file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

Database Tracking: Uses MongoDB (via Mongoose) to track payment status, M-Pesa Reference ID, and collection deadlines.

Email Notifications: Sends order confirmation emails to the customer upon successful payment and file upload.

Admin Dashboard: Provides a dashboard to view all orders, payment status, and secure download links.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment to Google Cloud Run (Declarative Method)
This project uses a declarative deployment approach with a Dockerfile and a service.yaml file, ensuring repeatable and secure deployments.

Prerequisites
GCP Project: Ensure you have an active GCP project ([YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID]).

GCP CLI: Install and configure the gcloud command-line tool.

Service Account: Create a dedicated service account and grant it the Storage Object Admin role and the Cloud Run Invoker role.

Step 1: Configure YAML and Initial Deploy
Update cloudrun/service.yaml:

Replace all bracketed placeholders (e.g., [YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID], [YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL], and all credential values) with your actual secrets.



Validation URL: [Your Cloud Run URL]/api/mpesa/callback
